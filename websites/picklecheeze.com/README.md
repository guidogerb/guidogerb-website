## Structure

```
src/
  App.jsx                # Landing sections + protected partner hub
  headerSettings.js      # Shared header navigation definition
  footerSettings.js      # Shared footer links and copy
  website-components/
    welcome-page/        # Authenticated welcome card personalised for partners
```

The header navigation scrolls to marketing sections using the shared router, which also powers the `/maintenance` route and branded 404 experience. Authenticated partners see quick links to PDF resources and contact emails sourced from the welcome component, and each resource can be toggled with the feature flags above.
