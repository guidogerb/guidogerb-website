# @guidogerb/components/storage Task Tracker

The storage package currently exposes only a placeholder component stub. The tasks below map the work required to deliver the
browser storage orchestration layer that will eventually manage persistence, cookies, and caching coordination for the service
worker utilities.

| Task Name | Created Date | In Progress | Complete Date | Task Details |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Establish documentation for package scope and integration expectations | 2025-09-19 | No | 2025-09-19 | Flesh out a README that explains the storage responsibilities, public surface, and relationship to the service worker helpers. |
| Design a storage controller API surface | 2025-09-19 | No | - | Define modules (e.g., `createStorageController`) that wrap localStorage, sessionStorage, and cookies with consistent error handling and serialization. |
| Implement persistent storage adapters | 2025-09-19 | No | - | Build read/write/remove helpers for localStorage and sessionStorage, including JSON encoding safeguards and SSR fallbacks. |
| Deliver cookie management utilities | 2025-09-19 | No | - | Provide helpers to read, write, and expire cookies with support for domain/path/secure attributes and same-site policies. |
| Orchestrate cache preference hand-off to `@guidogerb/components/sw` | 2025-09-19 | No | - | Expose a configuration channel (event emitter or shared store) so the storage layer can toggle service worker caching strategies at runtime. |
| Add unit tests and examples | 2025-09-19 | No | - | Create Vitest suites covering storage fallbacks, cookie parsing, and SW coordination mocks once implementation lands. |
