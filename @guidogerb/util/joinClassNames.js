 * Accepts any combination of strings, arrays, booleans, nulls or undefined values and joins the truthy class names into a

 *
 * The utility is deliberately forgiving â€“ anything that is not a string simply passes through the filtering stage and is
 * ignored.  Arrays are flattened recursively so nested lists of classes are supported.
 *
 * @param {(string | boolean | any[] | null | undefined)[]} classNames Values representing CSS class names.
 * @returns {string} A string safe to pass to React's `className` prop.
