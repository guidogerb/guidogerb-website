# Testing Backlog

This backlog enumerates every application-facing workspace in the monorepo and captures the next test milestones so the new Vitest suite can expand consistently across packages.

## Shared component packages

| Package | Current coverage | Follow-up tasks |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `@guidogerb/components/api-client` | ✅ HTTP client unit tests cover configuration, token injection, retries, and error normalization. | Plan contract tests once additional endpoints ship (e.g., pagination helpers, error mapping). |
| `@guidogerb/components/auth` | ✅ Auth flow tests cover the provider, wrapper, and callback utilities. | Add integration tests that exercise real OIDC context mocks (refresh, logout) and ensure redirect guards work inside consuming apps. |
| `@guidogerb/components/menu` | _None_ | Outline snapshot/interaction tests after the menu component is built; verify ARIA roles and keyboard navigation. |
| `@guidogerb/components/pages-public` | _None_ | When the public page shells are available, verify that required routes render without protected context. |
| `@guidogerb/components/pages-protected` | _None_ | After dashboard/page stubs ship, add tests for auth gating and feature flag rendering. |
| `@guidogerb/components/router-public` | _None_ | Plan routing smoke tests to ensure the public router exposes expected paths and fallbacks. |
| `@guidogerb/components/router-protected` | _None_ | Add tests validating protected route guards, redirects, and breadcrumb helpers. |
| `@guidogerb/components/sw` | _None_ | Once the service worker gains caching logic, create unit tests for precache manifest wiring and update notifications. |
| `@guidogerb/components/ui` | _None_ | After real UI widgets are implemented, cover them with accessibility checks and regression snapshots. |
| `@guidogerb/css` | _None_ | Capture token regression tests (e.g., CSS variables) with a style snapshot once tokens stabilize. |
| `@guidogerb/footer` | _None_ | Add render tests verifying link sets per tenant once the footer is implemented. |
| `@guidogerb/header` | _None_ | After header settings helpers are finished, add tests for context defaults, mutation helpers, and responsive rendering. |

## Tenant websites

| Package | Current coverage | Follow-up tasks |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `websites/garygerber.com` | _None_ | Add route smoke tests that ensure the landing page renders with shared header/footer and protected sections defer to auth mocks. |
| `websites/guidogerbpublishing.com` | _None_ | Mirror the Gary Gerber site checks and verify publishing-specific copy renders. |
| `websites/picklecheeze.com` | _None_ | Add snapshot/interaction tests for unique theming once components exist. |
| `websites/this-is-my-story.org` | _None_ | Add tests for story navigation flows and ensure 404 handling works. |
| `websites/stream4cloud.com` | _None_ | Cover the landing page hero, CTA wiring, and route guards once the app shell exists. |

## Cross-cutting infrastructure

- Create shared test utilities (test render wrapper, auth context factory, storage mocks) as soon as multiple packages consume the new suite.
- Decide on coverage thresholds once core packages add real logic; start by monitoring Vitest's HTML/text reports generated by `pnpm -r test`.
